This is my Linux Mint Conky configuration file.<br><br>
Run the bash script 'install.sh' as super user.<br>
Using System Settings -> Startup Applications place a new entry called Conky.<br>
The command line should be entered as 'Conky -d'.<br><br>
Reset the PC.<br>
When the desktop appears there should be a nice system information display on the top right hand corner down the screen.<br><br>
