This is my Linux Mint Conky configuration file.

Run the bash script 'install.sh' as super user.
Using System Settings -> Startup Applications place a new entry called Conky.
The command line should be entered as 'Conky -d'.

Reset the PC. When the desktop appears there should be a nice system information display on the top right hand corner down the screen.
